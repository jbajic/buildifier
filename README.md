## Example Usage

To use `buildifier` action you can follow presented examples to see how it works:

### Check every file
```yml
name: Bazel files check
on: [push]
jobs:
  formatting-check:
    name: Run buildifier check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Run buildifier
      uses: jbajic/buildifier@v1
```

### Check files in `src` directory
```yml
name: Check bazel files
on: [push]
jobs:
  formatting-check:
    name: Run buildifier check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Run buildifier
      uses: jbajic/buildifier@v1
      with:
        path: src
```

### Check all Bazel files and print out the difference
```yml
name: Check bazel files
on: [push]
jobs:
  formatting-check:
    name: Run buildifier check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Run buildifier
      uses: jbajic/buildifier@v1
      with:
        path: src
        mode: diff
```

To print out the diff two steps will be performed:
 1. Run buildifier in `multi_diff` mode,
 2. Run `git diff` and print out the changes.
